The files in here are simple graphviz files. They are meant to (loosely) give a
sense of the 'grammar' of the files to be parsed for each of the Senate, the
House, and the Extensions of Remarks. Following these diagrams is unlikely to
be a bulletproof guarantee but its a pretty good reference. 

The graphviz (.gv) files should already be compiled into images, but if not you
can generate the compiled output like so:

dot -Tpng senate.gv -o senate.png

where -T specifies the output format (here specified as png), senate.gv is the
input file, and -o is the switch to specify the outpul file (here given as
senate.png)
